## üóíÔ∏è Overview

Bentico (Benthic) is a comprehensive project thoroughly designed with the explicit goal of establishing a robust foundation for the development of rootkits. By offering a centralized repository of knowledge, Bentico stands as a valuable initiative for anyone looking to contribute to and benefit from the collective understanding of this field. However, it is imperative to underscore that Bentico is not a tool intended for malicious purposes; rather, it is a carefully constructed initiative for educational exploration and practical insights.

Bentico's significance extends beyond its basic functionality within Windows environments; it serves as a gateway for individuals venturing into the intricate and advanced field of rootkit development.

## üêô What is a Rootkit?

"A Rootkit is a collection of software designed to give malicious actors control of a computer network or application. Once activated, the malicious program sets up a backdoor exploit and may deliver additional malware, such as ransomware, bots, keyloggers or trojans. Rootkits may remain in place for years because they are hard to detect, due in part to their ability to block some antivirus software and malware scanner software. Known rootkits can be classified into a few broad families, although there are many hybrids as well. One of the most well-known types is the kernel mode rootkit (complicated to create), a sophisticated piece of malware that can add new code to the operating system or delete and edit operating system code." ~ [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/malware/rootkits/)

Essentially, a rootkit is a form of malicious software strategically designed to target a computer's operating system while hiding its presence and activities from users and security solutions.

In the case of Bentico, this manifests as a specialized focus on the complexities inherent in developing Windows kernel mode drivers.

## ü™ü Windows Kernel

The [Windows Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_kernel/) is the core of the Windows operating system, responsible for managing hardware, memory, processes, and security at the lowest level. It operates in Ring 0 (privileged mode), allowing direct interaction with system resources.


<div id='windowskernelkeyresponsabilitiesofthewindowskernel'/>

### üîç Key Responsibilities of the Windows Kernel
- Process and Thread Management: Handles process scheduling, thread execution, and synchronization mechanisms.
- Memory Management: Manages virtual memory, paging, and address translation.
- Device and Driver Communication: Provides APIs for Kernel Mode Drivers (KMDF/UMDF) to interact with hardware.
- Security and Access Control: Implements User Mode vs Kernel Mode separation to enforce system integrity.
- I/O Management: Handles file systems, networking, and system services.


<div id='windowskernelkernelmodevsusermode'/>

### ‚ö° Kernel Mode vs User Mode
| Feature              | User Mode                 | Kernel Mode                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
|    Access Level      | Restricted (Ring 3)       | Full System Access (Ring 0)     |
|    Performance       | Lower (API abstraction)   | Higher (Direct hardware access) |
|    Security          | Isolated from the OS core | Runs with full privileges       |
|    Crash Impact      | Affects only the process  | Can crash the entire system     |


<div id='windowskernelwhydevelopkernelmodedrivers'/>

### üõ†Ô∏è Why Develop Kernel Mode Drivers?

Kernel Mode development is essential for:

- Developing custom drivers for new hardware or virtualization.
- Implementing security tools such as anti-cheat engines, endpoint security solutions, and forensic tools.
- Manipulating system behavior for research or rootkit development.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Kernel development requires careful implementation to avoid system crashes, privilege escalation vulnerabilities, and performance issues.*

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

* **Secure Boot (Anti-Bootkit Installation)**: [Secure Boot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot) is a security feature that ensures a device boots using software trusted by the manufacturer. It verifies the digital signature of the boot loaders to prevent unauthorized applications from running during the boot process. Secure Boot uses a set of keys (PK, KEK, db, dbx) to manage this verification process, allowing only signed software to execute.
* **Early Launch AntiMalware - ELAM (Anti-Rootkit Installation)**: The [Early Launch AntiMalware](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/early-launch-antimalware) feature allows anti-malware software to start before all other drivers. This early start ensures that the anti-malware software can check and verify the integrity of startup drivers and services, helping to prevent malware from executing at the earliest possible point in the boot process.
* **Driver Signature Enforcement - DSE (Anti-Rootkit Installation)**: [Driver Signature Enforcement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-signing) is a security feature that ensures only drivers signed by a trusted authority can be loaded into the Windows operating system. This helps prevent the installation of drivers that could be malicious or unstable, thereby maintaining system integrity and stability.
* **Driver Blocklist for Vulnerable Drivers - (Anti-Rootkit Installation via BYOVD)** - [Driver Blocklist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules) prevents the loading of known vulnerable drivers exploited in [BYOVD](https://blogs.vmware.com/security/2023/04/bring-your-own-backdoor-how-vulnerable-drivers-let-hackers-in.html) (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) attacks. This feature ensures system integrity by blocking outdated or compromised drivers, even if signed, using technologies like HVCI and WDAC, providing an additional layer of kernel-level security.
* **Kernel Patch Protection - Patchguard (Anti-Rootkit Deep Funcionalities)**: Kernel Patch Protection, also known as Patchguard, is a feature in 64-bit versions of Windows that prevents unauthorized modification of the Windows kernel. This security measure helps protect the kernel from rootkits and other forms of malware that attempt to insert malicious code into the kernel space.
* **Virtualization Based Security - VBS (Global)** - [Virtualization Based Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs) uses hardware virtualization features to create and isolate a secure region of memory from the normal operating system. VBS can help protect Windows from vulnerabilities in the operating system and from malicious software that attempts to tamper with the kernel and system processes. This secure environment is used to host several security solutions, such as [Credential Guard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/), providing enhanced protection against advanced security threats.

## ü¶† Bentico Windows Rootkit

As I mentioned during my talk at RootedCON Madrid 2025, I will be releasing the full rootkit in a few months, but first, I want my students to have exclusive access throughout this academic year before making it publicly available.

You already have the foundation and most of the rootkit's functionalities available separately in the rootkits folder, so with the extensive resources provided, you can develop your own version. With the talk I gave and the repositories I've shared, you have everything you need to make it happen, and even improve it.

That's ultimately my goal - bringing this complex field closer to you üòä.
