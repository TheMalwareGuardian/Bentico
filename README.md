This repository originally hosted early research notes and proof-of-concept prototypes, which eventually evolved into the **[Benthic Windows Kernel Rootkit](https://github.com/TheMalwareGuardian/Benthic)**, the kernel-mode rootkit component of the **[Abyss UEFI Bootkit](https://github.com/TheMalwareGuardian/Abyss)**. We will present both projects during our upcoming **[DEF CON 33 Main Stage Talk](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-33/dc-33-speakers.html#content_60321)**.

- To prepare for the release, earlier resources have been removed so the updated, clean version of the project can be published here on the day of the talk without conflicts.  
- After the talk, this repository will be updated with the exact version of the project presented at DEF CON, for archival and reference purposes.  

**Ongoing development and future updates will continue exclusively in the official [Benthic repository](https://github.com/TheMalwareGuardian/Benthic).**
