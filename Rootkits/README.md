## ***üÜï First Time?***

<p align="center">

</p>

Building your first rootkit isn't just about writing stealthy code, it's about reshaping how the system sees itself. This isn't malware in userspace. It's kernel-level manipulation, where processes vanish, files become ghosts, and network traffic bends to your control. You're not playing by the OS rules anymore. You're rewriting them. But before you can hide in plain sight, you need to understand the very internals you're about to subvert.

## ***üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures***

* **Secure Boot (Anti-Bootkit Installation)**: [Secure Boot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot) is a security feature that ensures a device boots using software trusted by the manufacturer. It verifies the digital signature of the boot loaders to prevent unauthorized applications from running during the boot process. Secure Boot uses a set of keys (PK, KEK, db, dbx) to manage this verification process, allowing only signed software to execute.
* **Early Launch AntiMalware - ELAM (Anti-Rootkit Installation)**: The [Early Launch AntiMalware](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/early-launch-antimalware) feature allows anti-malware software to start before all other drivers. This early start ensures that the anti-malware software can check and verify the integrity of startup drivers and services, helping to prevent malware from executing at the earliest possible point in the boot process.
* **Driver Signature Enforcement - DSE (Anti-Rootkit Installation)**: [Driver Signature Enforcement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-signing) is a security feature that ensures only drivers signed by a trusted authority can be loaded into the Windows operating system. This helps prevent the installation of drivers that could be malicious or unstable, thereby maintaining system integrity and stability.
* **Driver Blocklist for Vulnerable Drivers - (Anti-Rootkit Installation via BYOVD)** - [Driver Blocklist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules) prevents the loading of known vulnerable drivers exploited in [BYOVD](https://blogs.vmware.com/security/2023/04/bring-your-own-backdoor-how-vulnerable-drivers-let-hackers-in.html) (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) attacks. This feature ensures system integrity by blocking outdated or compromised drivers, even if signed, using technologies like HVCI and WDAC, providing an additional layer of kernel-level security.
* **Kernel Patch Protection - Patchguard (Anti-Rootkit Deep Funcionalities)**: Kernel Patch Protection, also known as Patchguard, is a feature in 64-bit versions of Windows that prevents unauthorized modification of the Windows kernel. This security measure helps protect the kernel from rootkits and other forms of malware that attempt to insert malicious code into the kernel space.
* **Virtualization Based Security - VBS (Global)** - [Virtualization Based Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs) uses hardware virtualization features to create and isolate a secure region of memory from the normal operating system. VBS can help protect Windows from vulnerabilities in the operating system and from malicious software that attempts to tamper with the kernel and system processes. This secure environment is used to host several security solutions, such as [Credential Guard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/), providing enhanced protection against advanced security threats.

## ***ü™ü Windows Kernel***

The [Windows Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_kernel/) is the core of the Windows operating system, responsible for managing hardware, memory, processes, and security at the lowest level. It operates in Ring 0 (privileged mode), allowing direct interaction with system resources.


<div id='windowskernel-keyresponsabilitiesofthewindowskernel'/>

### ***üîç Key Responsibilities of the Windows Kernel***
- Process and Thread Management: Handles process scheduling, thread execution, and synchronization mechanisms.
- Memory Management: Manages virtual memory, paging, and address translation.
- Device and Driver Communication: Provides APIs for Kernel Mode Drivers (KMDF/UMDF) to interact with hardware.
- Security and Access Control: Implements User Mode vs Kernel Mode separation to enforce system integrity.
- I/O Management: Handles file systems, networking, and system services.


<div id='windowskernel-kernelmodevsusermode'/>

## ***üí£ Proofs of Concepts (Malicious Kernel Mode Drivers)***

This folder contains a variety of Windows kernel-mode drivers developed to demonstrate rootkit basic functionalities:


* _**KernelRootkit001_HelloWorld**_
	* _**KMDFDriver_HelloWorld**_ is a Windows kernel-mode driver that serves as a demonstration of basic rootkit functionality. The driver's primary purpose is to load into the kernel and print a "Hello World" debug message as part of its initialization process. It also includes a DriverUnload routine to handle the unloading and cleanup of the driver.

* _**KernelRootkit002_Threading**_
	* _**KMDFDriver_Threading**_ is a Windows kernel-mode driver that serves as a demonstration of basic rootkit functionality. The driver's primary purpose is to create and manage a persistent system thread that periodically logs messages to the kernel debugger. The driver initializes by spawning a system thread that executes at regular intervals, printing a timestamped "Hello World" message. It also includes a DriverUnload routine to properly terminate the thread and clean up resources before unloading the driver from the system.

* _**KernelRootkit003_ZwFunctions**_
	* _**KMDFDriver_ZwFunctions.c**_ is a Windows kernel-mode driver that serves as a demonstration of basic rootkit functionality. The driver's primary purpose is to interact with the Windows kernel using Zw (NTAPI) functions to perform file operations and retrieve system information. Specifically, the driver creates a file, logs OS version details into it, and appends data using ZwCreateFile and ZwWriteFile. It also includes a DriverUnload routine to clean up and delete the file upon removal.

* _**KernelRootkit004_IOCTLs**_
	* _**ConsoleApp_IOCTLs**_ is a user-mode application that interacts with a kernel-mode driver by sending IOCTL (Input/Output Control) requests and processing its responses. It serves as the interface for executing rootkit functionalities from user space.
	* _**KMDFDriver_IOCTLs**_ is a Windows kernel-mode driver that serves as a demonstration of a basic rootkit functionality. This driver is responsible for handling IOCTL requests initiated by a user-level application. It defines IOCTL command codes and implements corresponding functionality for each one.

* _**KernelRootkit005_Callbacks**_
	* _**KMDFDriver_Callbacks**_ is a Windows kernel-mode driver that serves as a demonstration of a basic rootkit functionality. This driver registers kernel event callbacks to monitor system activity, specifically tracking process creation and termination in real time. By leveraging PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine and PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx, it captures parent-child process relationships while enforcing restrictions on specific executables, actively blocking the execution of certain processes to prevent the launch of debugging and monitoring tools.

* _**KernelRootkit006_DKOM**_
	* _**ConsoleApp_DKOM**_ is a user-mode application that interacts with a kernel-mode driver to manipulate process structures in memory.
	* _**KMDFDriver_DKOM**_ is a Windows kernel-mode driver that serves as a demonstration of a basic rootkit functionality. It manipulates kernel structures using Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM) to hide processes by unlinking them from the ActiveProcessLinks list, bypassing standard process enumeration methods.
