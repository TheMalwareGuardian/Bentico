### üßê Kernel Callback Functions

Kernel callback functions provide a way for drivers to receive notifications about critical system events, allowing them to monitor and interact with the operating system at a lower level. These callbacks are commonly used for security, logging, and performance monitoring purposes. By registering callback routines, a driver can be alerted when specific actions occur, such as process creation, thread termination, or registry modifications, enabling real-time system monitoring.

Two important types of kernel callbacks are process and registry callbacks. Process callbacks, registered using PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine or PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx, notify drivers when a process is created or terminated, making them useful for detecting unauthorized software execution or enforcing security policies. Registry callbacks, set via CmRegisterCallback, allow monitoring and filtering of registry operations, which is particularly useful for detecting malware persistence mechanisms or preventing unauthorized modifications to system configurations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Create a New Kernel Mode Driver Project**
	- Open [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).
	- Create a new project: 
		- Click 'Create a new project'.
		- Search for templates (Alt + S) and select 'Kernel Mode Driver, Empty (KMDF)'.
		- Click 'Next'.
	- Enter the project name as 'KMDFDriver_Callbacks', the solution name as 'KernelRootkit005_Callbacks', and click 'Create'.

2. **Add Source Code**
	- In the Solution Explorer, navigate to 'Source Files'.
	- Right-click on 'Source Files -> Add -> New Item...'.
	- Select 'C++ File (.cpp)' and name it 'Driver.c'.
	- Paste the driver source code into that file.

3. **Set the Build Configuration**
	- In the toolbar, set the configuration to 'Release' and 'x64'.

4. **Build the Solution**
	- Go to 'Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Command Line'.
	- Add '/integritycheck' to the 'Additional Options'.
	- Go to 'Build -> Build Solution' or press 'Ctrl + Shift + B'.
	- If the build succeeds, locate the compiled '.sys' driver file at:
		```
		C:\Users\%USERNAME%\source\repos\KernelRootkit005_Callbacks\x64\Release\KMDFDriver_Callbacks.sys
		```

5. **Prepare the Virtual Machine**
	- Use [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to start your virtual machine (e.g., MalwareWindows11).
	- Copy the driver file ('KMDFDriver_Callbacks.sys') to the virtual machine's 'C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads\' directory.

6. **Enable Test Mode in Windows**
	- On the virtual machine, open a Command Prompt (CMD) window as an Administrator and run:
		```
		bcdedit /set testsigning on
		```
	- Restart the virtual machine to apply the changes. After restarting, a "Test Mode" watermark will appear on the desktop, indicating test signing is enabled.
	- Test Mode allows the installation of unsigned drivers by disabling [Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-signing), which ensures only signed drivers are loaded.

7. **Install the Driver**
	- In the virtual machine, open a CMD window as an Administrator.
	- Navigate to the directory containing the driver ('C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads\').
	- Run the following commands to install the driver:
		```
		sc.exe stop WindowsKernelCallbacks
		sc.exe delete WindowsKernelCallbacks
		sc.exe create WindowsKernelCallbacks type=kernel start=demand binpath="C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads\KMDFDriver_Callbacks.sys"
		```

8. **Verify Driver Installation**
	- Open [Autoruns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns) as Administrator.
	- Navigate to the Drivers tab.
	- Look for the service WindowsKernelCallbacks in the list.
	- Ensure that the path matches the one used during the sc.exe create command.
	- This step confirms that the driver is correctly registered in the system.

9. **Monitor Driver Messages**
	- Open [DebugView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview) as an Administrator.
	- Enable the following options:
		- 'Capture -> Capture Kernel'
		- 'Capture -> Enable Verbose Kernel Output'
	- Close DebugView and reopen it as Administrator to ensure proper functionality. This step helps avoid issues with message capture, which can occur the first time these options are enabled.

10. **Start the Driver**
	- Run the following command in the CMD window as an Administrator:
		```
		sc.exe start WindowsKernelCallbacks
		```
	- Observe debug messages in DebugView to verify the driver's functionality.

11. **Verify Functionality**
	- Depending on the driver's purpose, perform tests to confirm it works as expected. Examples include observing process creation logs, testing filesystem filters, or interacting with specific driver behavior.

12. **Remove the Driver**
	- To stop and remove the driver after testing, run the following commands in a CMD window as an Administrator:
		```
		sc.exe stop WindowsKernelCallbacks
		sc.exe delete WindowsKernelCallbacks
		```

13. **Disable Test Mode (Optional)**
	- After testing, you can disable Test Mode by running:
		```
		bcdedit /set testsigning off
		```
	- Restart the virtual machine to apply the changes.
